There once was a boy named Harry Potter. His parents passed away when he was very young, so he lived with his aunt and uncle.
He did not like his aunt and uncle very much, as they did not treat him very well. One day, a large and strong man named Hagrid
came to his house.

"How would you like to study magic?" asked Hagrid. Harry was very interested, and was invited to start school at Hogwarts. 
Harry accepted this offer. He had a natural talent, and would pick up magic quickly. He would soon find out the practical usage
of magic, and why he was needed.
